# Diabetes Prediction Challenge

An **interactive AI-powered application** to estimate an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on lifestyle, clinical, and biometric indicators. Built with Python, machine learning, and a user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time health assessment.

## Project Structure
- **Data:** Train and test datasets (download from Kaggle, not included due to size).  
- **Models:** Pre-trained ML model and preprocessing pipeline.  
- **Notebooks:** EDA and experiments.  
- **App:** Streamlit web app for interactive risk prediction.  
- **Scripts:** Data loading, preprocessing, model training, and inference.

## Installation & Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
